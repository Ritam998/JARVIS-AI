JARVIS-AI is a voice-enabled intelligent assistant developed using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning techniques. The system accepts voice commands, converts speech into text, processes user intent, and generates meaningful responses in real time. It demonstrates practical implementation of AI-driven human–computer interaction through an end-to-end voice assistant pipeline.

The project is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend with additional features such as database integration, task automation, API connectivity, and large language models (LLMs). JARVIS-AI serves as a strong demonstration of applied AI concepts, including speech recognition, intent processing, and intelligent response generation.
